sh get-docker.sh

# Install Docker Compose
apt-get update
apt-get install docker-compose-plugin

# Verify
docker --version
docker compose version
```

- [ ] Docker installed successfully
- [ ] Docker Compose installed successfully

#### Step 3: Deploy Application

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/sayedhany/full-stack-ecomerce.git
cd full-stack-ecomerce

# Create .env file
nano .env
# (Paste your production environment variables)

# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Check logs
docker compose logs -f
```

- [ ] Repository cloned
- [ ] `.env` file configured with production values
- [ ] Services started successfully
- [ ] All containers healthy

#### Step 4: Configure Domain & SSL

```bash
# Install Certbot
apt-get install certbot

# Get SSL certificate
certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com

# Copy certificates
mkdir -p ssl
cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem ssl/
cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem ssl/

# Update Nginx config
nano backend/nginx-fullstack.conf
# (Uncomment HTTPS section and update domain)

# Restart Nginx
docker compose restart nginx
```

- [ ] SSL certificate obtained
- [ ] Nginx configured for HTTPS
- [ ] HTTPS working at https://yourdomain.com

### For Railway.app (Easiest)
